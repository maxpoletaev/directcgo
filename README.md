# directcgo - Minimal Cost C Interop

tl;dr: This is an experimental way of executing C code from Go, which targets one specific case: calling fast short-lived C functions in a loop (e.g., immediate mode graphic apps, game engines, SIMD code) with minimal possible overhead. Basically, what the original cgo design is infamous for. The suggested solution does not provide the same safety guarantees as cgo, and is not suitable for long-running or blocking C functions.

There are two main reasons why cgo is considered slow in certain scenarios (of course, slow here [is not slow per se][4], we're talking about dozens of nanoseconds of overhead per call, it's just that this overhead gets accumulated quickly when a function is called hundreds of times per frame, and it is slower than most [FFI implementations][5] out there). The technical aspects have probably been described and discussed in great detail across many posts and articles on the internet, but in a nutshell:

 1. Goroutines use dynamic stacks managed by the runtime. The stacks may grow, shrink and moved around at any time, which makes them not very suitable for C calls, nor is it possible to control the stack size from the C code being called. Due to this limitation, every cgo call is implemented by jumping to the system stack (the stack where the runtime is running), executing the code there, and jumping back.

 2. Go wants C calls to natively fit into Go's concurrency model, making an assumption that any cgo call may block indefinitely. Therefore, any C call requires additional cooperation with the scheduler, such as removing threads occupied with C code from the thread pool and spawning new threads to compensate for the loss. This does have certain benefits if the program mainly uses C functions to offload heavy work or I/O, but greatly reduces throughput for small and quick C functions which need to be called at higher frequency.

## Stage 1: Bypassing Runtime

The idea initially came from [fastcgo][1] (which, in turn, was inspired by [rustgo][2]) that avoids interacting with the scheduler and jumps to the system stack directly. A [thread][3] on Google Groups made me think if we could also get away with running C code right on the goroutine stack to avoid rapid context switches. And it turns out, we could!

What the code in this repo tries to do is basically run C code on the same goroutine stack, ensuring that there is a reasonable stack space available to safely run this code. This brings it very close to the efficiency of native function calls (because it is essentially calling native functions, using the standard ABI calling convention for the target architecture). 

Performance-wise, this has only 2.5-3x overhead (introduced by an extra layer of indirection through the assembly code) compared to native Go calls, while traditional Cgo slaps you with a 30-40x penalty (go 1.23):

```

```

From the table above we can see that calling C through directcgo is as fast as calling assembly, maybe a tiny bit slower. But note an interesting observation: assembly itself is slower to call than **non-inlined** Go functions. This is because the calling convention between Go and assembly relies exclusively on passing arguments through the stack, while Go-to-Go calls can go (pun intended) through registers. So 2.5ns is our theoretical minimum, and we can't go any lower than that without an [ABI update][9] (may happen) and/or proper [assembly inlining][8] (not going to happen). 

The implementation itself is so simple it's almost embarrassing, and pretty future-proof, as it does not rely that much on runtime internals. All we need is a so-called assembly trampoline that will set up a stack frame large enough to fit the entire C stack and arrange the arguments according to the ABI standard on the target platform:

```
//go:build arm64

// func Call(fn unsafe.Pointer, arg unsafe.Pointer, ret unsafe.Pointer)
TEXT Â·Call(SB), $1048576-24 // 1MB stack frame, 24 bytes for parameters
    MOVD    fn+0(FP), R2
    MOVD    arg+8(FP), R0
    MOVD    ret+16(FP), R1
    MOVD    RSP, R20
    MOVD    $1048576, R10
    ADD     R10, RSP
    BL      (R2)
    MOVD    R20, RSP
    RET
```

*(the real code is a little longer as it includes checks for the stack overflow and does proper stack alignment, but you get the idea)*

And some wrapping code for passing function arguments and return values:

```go
/*
#include "code.h"
#include <stdint.h>

void ffi_addTwoNumbers(void *arg, void *ret) {
    struct { 
        uint32_t a; 
        uint32_t b;
    } *a = arg;

    uint32_t sum = addTwoNumbers(a->a, a->b);
    *(uint32_t *)ret = sum;
}
*/
import "C"
import "unsafe"

func AddTwoNumbers(a, b uint32) (ret uint32) {
    type args struct {
        a uint32
        b uint32
    }
    directcgo.Call(
        C.ffi_addTwoNumbers, 
        unsafe.Pointer(&args{a, b}), 
        unsafe.Pointer(&ret),
    )
    return ret
}
```

## Stage 2: Assembly Codegen

One way of making this a little bit more interesting is getting rid of C wrappers and moving all the wrapping into assembly. That would mean we need to make an assembly code generator, capable of reading C function declarations and producing code that maps arguments and return values to the C function ABI.
```
$ directcgo -arch=amd64,arm64 ./testsuite/binding
```

What it does is reads Go function declarations from the provided package:

```go
package binding

//go:noescape
func AddTwoNumbers(cfun unsafe.Pointer, a, b uint32) uint32

//go:noescape
func AddTwoFloats(cfun unsafe.Pointer, a, b float32) float32
```

and generates a bunch of `*.s` files containing assembly implementations of those declarations that do all the magic of calling and forwarding arguments to the C function. The first argument is a pointer to the function we want to call, and the rest are the arguments we want to pass to it.

For now, only primitive types are reliably supported (ints, floats, pointers). Passing structs is work-in-progress. Small structs (under 16 bytes) kind of work already, but might be buggy (the ABI for passing structs is pure hell). Passing arguments through stack is not supported too, so you are limited to something like 6-8 integer and floating point arguments. Both AMD64 and ARM64 are supported, but only on Linux and macOS, since Windows ABI is different enough to require a separate implementation.

## Caveats

Trying to bypass cgo in order to squeeze out every last bit of performance needs a good justification, as it comes with a lot of potential caveats:

 1. Unusual stack sizes. This method will create goroutines with stacks that are probably too large for spawning thousands of them, but not large enough to match the size of the system stack. This repo experiments with ~~1MB~~ 64KB stack size, so prior to the C call, Go will allocate a 64KB stack frame for each goroutine calling to C code. That will likely lead to OOM when spawned uncontrollably, so you may want to create a dedicated pool of "fat" goroutines with bigger stacks for calling C code this way.

 2. C calls do not inform the scheduler about their presence. The thread calling to C code will block until the C function returns, effectively blocking other goroutines waiting in the run queue on that thread. There is no way for the scheduler to preempt the running C function, which, in turn, may lead to other negative side effects like delaying garbage collector phases due to the goroutine not being able to reach a safepoint. That's why I said the function should be short-lived.

 3. There aren't any security measures in place. Like, no cgocheck or anything like that for checking that you are passing pointers to pinned Go memory. Also, stack overflow of a goroutine stack is not guaranteed to cause the program crash, as it may overflow into valid memory reserved by the go allocator. So, no safety nets, no helmet, just good old undefined behavior.

## If you want to use it

Mind that this is super experimental and by no means stable. The code is not well-tested, and there are probably a lot of bugs and edge cases that I haven't thought of, especially in the code produced by the codegen, as things like struct alignment are pretty tricky to get right.

But if you want to give it a try, do extensive stress testing under various conditions and input sizes before seriously considering using directcgo instead of cgo. Ideally, you should know what the code is doing, how much stack space it actually needs, and if there are any VLAs, alloca(), or recursion involved that may blow up the stack.

Again, all of this only make sense if the bottleneck is the internal mechanics of cgo itself, and not the actual C code being called. It is pretty easy to draw a [wrong conclusion][7] here, as the profiler only shows that `runtime.cgocall()` takes a lot of time, but it does not show what the C code is doing inside.
