# directcgo - Minimal Cost C Interop

tl;dr: This is an experimental way of executing C code from Go, which targets one specific case: calling fast short-lived C functions in a loop (e.g., immediate mode graphic apps, game engines, SIMD code) with minimal possible overhead. Basically, what the original cgo design is infamous for.

There are two main reasons why cgo is considered slow in such scenarios (of course, slow here [is not slow per se][4], we're talking about dozens of nanoseconds of overhead per call, it's just that this overhead gets accumulated quickly when a function is called hundreds of times per frame, and it is slower than most [FFI implementations][5]). The technical aspects have probably been described and discussed in great detail across many posts and articles on the internet, but in a nutshell:

 1. Goroutines use dynamic stacks managed by the runtime. The stacks may grow, shrink and moved around at any time, which makes them not very suitable for C calls, nor is it possible to control the stack size from the C code being called. Due to this limitation, every cgo call is implemented by jumping to the system stack (the stack where the runtime is running), executing the code there, and jumping back.

 2. Go wants C calls to natively fit into Go's concurrency model, making an assumption that any cgo call might block indefinitely. Therefore, any C call requires additional cooperation with the scheduler, like excluding threads occupied with C code from the thread pool and spawning new threads to compensate for the loss. This does have certain benefits if the program mainly uses C functions to offload heavy work or I/O, but greatly reduces throughput for small and quick C functions which need to be called at higher frequency.

## Stage 1: Bypassing runtime

The idea initially came from [fastcgo][1] (which, in turn, was inspired by [rustgo][2]) that avoids interacting with the scheduler and jumps to the system stack directly. A [thread][3] on Google Groups made me think if we could also get away with running C code right on the goroutine stack to avoid rapid context switches. And it turns out, we could!

What the code in this repo tries to do is basically run C code on the same goroutine stack, ensuring that there is a reasonable stack space available to safely run this code. This brings it very close to the efficiency of native function calls (because it is essentially calling native functions, using the standard ABI calling convention for the target architecture). Performance-wise, this has only 2.5-3x overhead (introduced by an extra layer of indirection through the assembly code) compared to native Go calls, while traditional Cgo slaps you with a 30-40x penalty (go 1.23).

BenchmarkAddTwoNumbersLoopNative-6   	10635810	       112.7 ns/op
```

The solution itself is so simple it's almost embarrassing, and pretty much future-proof, as it does not rely on any runtime internals. All we need is a so-called assembly trampoline that will set up a stack frame large enough to fit the entire C stack and arrange the arguments according to the ABI standard on the target platform:

```
//go:build arm64

// func Call(fn unsafe.Pointer, arg unsafe.Pointer, ret unsafe.Pointer)
TEXT Â·Call(SB), $1048576-24 // 1MB stack frame, 24 bytes for parameters
    MOVD    fn+0(FP), R2
    MOVD    arg+8(FP), R0
    MOVD    ret+16(FP), R1
    MOVD    $1048576, R10
    ADD     R10, RSP
    BL      (R2)
    RET
```

*(the real code is a bit more complex as it includes checks for the stack overflow and does proper stack alignment, but you get the idea)*

And some wrapping code for passing function arguments and return values:

```go
/*
#include "code.h"
#include <stdint.h>

void ffi_addTwoNumbers(void *arg, void *ret) {
    struct { 
        uint32_t a; 
        uint32_t b;
    } *a = arg;

    uint32_t sum = addTwoNumbers(a->a, a->b);
    *(uint32_t *)ret = sum;
}
*/
import "C"
import "unsafe"

func AddTwoNumbers(a, b uint32) (ret uint32) {
    type args struct {
        a uint32
        b uint32
    }
    directcgo.Call(
        C.ffi_addTwoNumbers, 
        unsafe.Pointer(&args{a, b}), 
        unsafe.Pointer(&ret),
    )
    return ret
}
```

## Stage 2: Code generation

One way of making this a little bit more engaging is getting rid of C wrappers and moving all the wrapping into assembly. That would mean we need to do some assembly code generation, but it's not that hard to implement (at least, that's what I thought), as we don't need to generate any complex code, just a bunch of trampolines for each function we want to call. So this repo also includes a simple code generator.

```
$ directcgo -arch=amd64,arm64 ./testsuite/asm
```

What it does is reads Go function declarations from the provided package:

```go
package asm

//go:noescape
func AddTwoNumbers(cfun unsafe.Pointer, a, b uint32) uint32

//go:noescape
func AddTwoFloats(cfun unsafe.Pointer, a, b float32) float32
```

and generates a bunch of `*.s` files containing assembly implementations of those declarations that do all the magic of calling and forwarding arguments to the C function. The first argument is a pointer to the function we want to call, and the rest are the arguments we want to pass to it. It can be later used like this:

```go
package main

func main() {
    ret := asm.AddTwoNumbers(C.addTwoNumbers, 1, 2)
    println(ret)
}
```

For now, only primitive types are reliably supported (ints, floats, pointers). Passing small structs (under 16 bytes) kind of works too, but might be buggy (the ABI for passing structs is pure hell, so I'm not sure if I want to support it at all). AMD64 and ARM64 are supported, but only on Linux and macOS. The Windows ABI is different enough to require a separate implementation.

Interestingly, it is now possible to completely ignore cgo, and collab with something like purego (using their dlopen/dlsym stub) to get a function pointer, and call it via the directcgo codegen. Because all you need is the actual pointer to a function, but it doesn't really matter where you've got it from.

## Caveats

Trying to bypass cgo in order to squeeze out every last bit of performance needs a good justification, as it comes with a lot of potential caveats:

 1. Unusual stack sizes. This method will create goroutines with stacks that are probably too large for spawning thousands of them, but not large enough to match the size of the system stack. This repo experiments with 1MB stack size, so prior to the C call, Go will allocate a 1MB stack frame for each goroutine calling to C code. That will likely lead to OOM when spawned uncontrollably, so you may want to create a dedicated pool of "fat" goroutines with bigger stacks for calling C code this way.

 2. C calls do not inform the scheduler about their presence. The thread calling to C code will block until the C function returns, effectively blocking other goroutines waiting in the run queue on that thread. There is no way for the scheduler to preempt the running C function, which, in turn, may lead to other negative side effects like delaying garbage collector phases due to the goroutine not being able to reach a safepoint. That's why I said the function should be short-lived.

 3. There aren't any security measures in place. Like, no cgocheck or anything like that for checking that you are passing pointers to pinned Go memory. Also, stack overflow of a goroutine stack is not guaranteed to cause the program crash, as it may overflow into valid memory reserved by the go allocator. So, no safety nets, no helmet, just good old undefined behavior.

It might be a good idea to use this method only for short-lived C functions in the hot path of the application, where the performance gain is significant enough to justify the risks. For everything else, just use cgo.

## If you want to use it

Mind that this is super experimental and by no means stable. The code is not well-tested, and there are probably a lot of bugs and edge cases that I haven't thought of, especially in the code produced by the codegen, as things like struct alignment are pretty tricky to get right.

But if you want to give it a try, do extensive stress testing under various conditions and input sizes before seriously considering using directcgo instead of cgo. Ideally, you should know what the code is doing, how much stack space it actually needs, and if there are any VLAs, alloca(), or recursion involved that may blow up the stack.
